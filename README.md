# DaisyBlue
A prototype project for connecting a series of speakers to stream synchronous audio to many small speakers through bluetooth.


## Current plan
### Step 1: Identify Hardware Components
Bluetooth Modules:

* Nordic Semiconductor nRF52840
* Texas Instruments CC2564
* Qualcomm QCC5124

Speakers:

High-fidelity Bluetooth speakers suitable for surround sound
Portable speakers with built-in amplifiers
Power Supply:

Rechargeable battery packs
AC adapters for continuous power
### Step 2: Identify Software Components
Bluetooth Audio Synchronization Techniques:

Research techniques like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and latency management
Software Libraries and APIs:

* BlueZ (Linux Bluetooth stack)
* Microsoft Windows Bluetooth API
* Apple's Core Bluetooth framework
* Real-time Audio Processing Frameworks:

* PulseAudio (Linux)
* WASAPI (Windows)
* Core Audio (macOS)
